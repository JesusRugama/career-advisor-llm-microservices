# Developer Profiles

This directory contains individual developer preference files that help AI assistants understand how to work effectively with each team member.

## Quick Setup
1. Copy `template.md` to `your-name.md`
2. Fill out your preferences and skill levels
3. These files are automatically gitignored for privacy
4. Update your profile as your preferences or skills change

## Benefits for Developers
- **Personalized AI assistance** - Get explanations at the right technical level
- **Consistent collaboration** - Same experience across different AI tools
- **Faster onboarding** - New AI assistants understand your style immediately
- **Better code reviews** - AI suggestions match your preferences
- **Learning support** - AI can focus on areas you want to improve

## Benefits for Teams
- **Knowledge sharing** - Understand how teammates prefer to work
- **Onboarding efficiency** - New team members can see collaboration patterns
- **Tool consistency** - All AI assistants work the same way across the team
- **Reduced friction** - Less time explaining preferences to each new AI tool

## Privacy & Security
- **Local only** - These files never leave your machine
- **Double protection** - Local `.gitignore` in this directory + project-level gitignore
- **Automatic privacy** - Individual profiles are ignored by default
- **Optional** - You can work without a profile, but experience may be generic
- **Updatable** - Change your preferences anytime

## Usage Tips

### For Individual Developers
- **Be honest about skill levels** - Better to get appropriate help than struggle
- **Update regularly** - Your preferences and skills evolve
- **Include context** - Mention specific frameworks or tools your team uses
- **Note learning goals** - AI can help you grow in areas you care about

### For Team Leads
- **Encourage adoption** - Better AI assistance benefits everyone
- **Respect privacy** - Don't pressure anyone to share their profile
- **Lead by example** - Create your own profile first
- **Gather feedback** - Ask how AI assistance could be improved

### For AI Assistants
- **Read profiles first** - Always check for developer preferences
- **Respect boundaries** - Honor automation levels and communication styles
- **Adapt dynamically** - Adjust based on context and feedback
- **Ask when unsure** - Better to clarify than make wrong assumptions

## Troubleshooting

### "AI doesn't understand my preferences"
- Check if your profile is complete and specific
- Add examples of what works/doesn't work for you
- Update your automation level preferences
- Include context about your current projects

### "AI explanations are too complex/simple"
- Adjust your skill level ratings
- Be more specific about explanation depth preferences
- Add notes about topics you want to learn vs already know
- Mention your experience with specific technologies

### "AI makes changes I don't like"
